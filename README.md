simple project that I made in 2~ days.

The voice you hear is from the streamelements API found in the <code>se.py</code> script, there are multiple voices you can choose from so check out the <code>voiceTypes.txt</code> file for most of them. <sub>I think...</sub>

## Setup
- Coded in Python 3.9.2. Install page here:

- This uses the AssemblyAI service which has 100 hours worth of audio transcription for free accounts. You can find it here: https://www.assemblyai.com/
